# DCSTheWay
Imports waypoints from DCS F10 map into the plane navigation system, like a Data Transfer Cartridge.
Special thanks to kukiric for helping out with the lua side of things!

## What does it do?
You choose points on the F10 map, press a button, and those points will be entered as steerpoints into your plane.  

## What is supported?
Supported modules:
* F-16
* F-16 I Sufa mod (For both pilot and WSO) 
* F/A-18 (make sure you are not in the TAC menu)
* A-10C and A-10C2
* Mirage 2000
* AV8BNA Harrier
* Ka-50 Blackshark
* AH-64D Apache 
 
Multiplayer is supported as long as the server has ownship/player exports turned on.

## How to install?
1. Download the latest zip file from the Releases section, and extract `The Way` folder inside it in a convenient location, from where you will run the program. 
2. Copy the `TheWay.lua` file from the folder you just extracted into `Users/YourUsernameHere/Saved Games/DCS/Scripts`. The `DCS` folder name may be `DCS.openbeta` if you are on the openbeta version of the game.
3. Edit the `Export.lua` file there and append this line at the end of the file, and save it:
  ```lua
  local TheWayLfs=require('lfs'); dofile(TheWayLfs.writedir()..'Scripts/TheWay.lua')
  ```
   If there is no `Export.lua` file already existing there, create it yourself, and it should include only the line above.

4. Launch `TheWay.exe` and go fly!

If you are updating from an older version, simply download the newest release, extract your new `The Way` folder ontop of your old one, replacing your existing files with the new ones. Also don't forget to copy your new `TheWay.lua` file into Saved Games, and override your old one there.

## How to use?

Or follow these steps:
1. Launch `TheWay.exe`.
2. Click `Start selecting on map`, and a selection dot will show on screen.
3. Enter the F10 map, position the dot on top of the desired place you wish to mark, and click `Select point`.
Repeat this step to mark as many points as you want.
4. When finished, enter the F1 cockpit view and click `Begin transfer to DCS` to begin the transfering process.
It is advised that you refrain from additional cockpit inputs until the waypoints have been loaded.

This is the way.
